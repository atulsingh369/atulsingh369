# Atul Singh — Full-Stack Engineer & AI Automation Architect  

I build autonomous AI systems and high-performance web applications that convert manual workflows into fully automated, production-grade platforms.  
I move fast: concept → architecture → deployment with scalable infrastructure.  

---
### What I work on

• AI agent systems with long-term memory, retrieval, and real-time decision execution    
• Distributed RAG pipelines, workflow automation, and multi-agent orchestration    
• Full-stack product engineering from 0 → production (Next.js, Firebase, FastAPI)

### Selected Projects

---

#### AI LinkedIn Auto Posting Agent — RAG-Based Content Generation & Auto-Publish  
Autonomous workflow that generates personalized storytelling-style LinkedIn posts using RAG memory, external research tools, cinematic image generation, and direct publishing via LinkedIn API.  

• RAG memory using Pinecone namespaces for style, strategy, identity & real stories  
• Multi-model agent orchestration with OpenAI, Cohere Rerank, SerpAPI & Brave Search  
• Gemini 2.5 Flash cinematic image creation synced to narrative theme  
• Automatic posting with LinkedIn OAuth pipeline   
• Fully automated: topic → RAG → post → image → publish  

⚡ Impact: Eliminates 1–2 hours of writing daily and automates 10–15 posts/week

#### AI X Auto Posting Agent — RAG-Powered Thread Generation & Auto-Publish
Autonomous workflow that converts topic input into multi-tweet thread posting on X (Twitter) with reply chaining, RAG identity memory, and real-time continuation state.  

• Multi-tweet thread generator using Pinecone RAG memory  
• Multi-model reasoning with OpenAI + fallback routing  
• External research integration via SerpAPI + Brave search  
• Automatic reply-chain posting with thread state persistence
