# Atul Singh — Full-Stack Engineer & AI Automation Architect

I architect autonomous AI systems that turn manual workflows into self-operating pipelines with real business outcomes. 
I move fast: from concept → production deployment with scalable backend infrastructure.

---
### What I work on

• AI agent systems with real-time memory, retrieval & decision execution  
• LLM workflow orchestration and distributed semantic indexing  
• End-to-end product builds from 0 → production
