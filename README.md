# Atul Singh — Full-Stack Engineer & AI Automation Architect

I architect autonomous AI systems that turn manual workflows into self-operating pipelines with real business outcomes. 
I move fast: from concept → production deployment with scalable backend infrastructure.

### What I work on

• AI agent systems with real-time memory, retrieval & decision execution  
• LLM workflow orchestration and distributed semantic indexing  
• End-to-end product builds from 0 → production

#### AI LinkedIn Auto Posting Agent — RAG-Based Content Generation & Auto-Publish
Autonomous workflow that generates personalized storytelling-style LinkedIn posts using RAG memory, external research tools, cinematic image generation, and direct publishing via LinkedIn API.

• RAG memory using Pinecone namespaces for style, strategy, identity & real stories  
• Multi-model agent orchestration with OpenAI, Cohere Rerank, SerpAPI & Brave Search  
• Gemini 2.5 Flash cinematic image creation synced to narrative theme  
• Automatic posting with LinkedIn OAuth pipeline  
• Fully automated: topic → RAG → post → image → publish

🚀 Impact: Eliminates 1–2 hours of writing daily and automates 10–15 posts/week

#### AI X Auto Posting Agent — RAG-Powered Thread Generation & Auto-Publish
Autonomous workflow that converts topic input into multi-tweet thread posting on X (Twitter) with reply chaining, RAG identity memory, and real-time continuation state.

• Multi-tweet thread generator using Pinecone RAG memory  
• Multi-model reasoning with OpenAI + fallback routing  
• External research integration via SerpAPI + Brave search  
• Automatic reply-chain posting with thread state persistence  
• Topic → Thread JSON → Publish via X API → Save ID → Auto-continue  

⚡ Impact: Zero manual thread writing, high engagement emotional storytelling
